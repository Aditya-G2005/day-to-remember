      <h3 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: Was It Always Meant to Happen?</h3>
      <p class="date">September 12, 2023</p>
      <p>
        Let me tell you something. Life doesn’t always go as planned. And that’s okay.
        <br><br>
        September 12, 2023. That’s the day it all began. Or maybe, the day I walked into something that was always waiting for me.
        <br><br>
        I stepped into MAIT. Not as a student. But as a dreamer. A fresh start. A new world.
        <br><br>
        The first day? Nothing like I imagined. No nervous excitement. Just raw, unfiltered energy. Standing on the edge of something unknown.
        <br><br>
        And then I met them. F1 and F2. Two minds. Equally restless. Equally reckless.
        <br><br>
        We weren’t just three college kids. We were three people who looked at the world and saw possibility. Not assignments. Not exams. But the chance to create something that would be ours. Something that wouldn’t just make money. But make us matter.
        <br><br>
        That’s how our startup was born. It wasn’t perfect. But it was real. We built. We strategized. We dreamed. We were the wolves. And the world was ours to conquer.
        <br><br>
        But here’s the thing about things that burn too fast. They crash even faster.
        <br><br>
        The same thing that brought us together became the very thing that pulled us apart. Visions clashed. Priorities shifted. Brotherhood turned into rivalry.
        <br><br>
        The startup we built? Gone.
        <br><br>
        The people we were? Gone.
        <br><br>
        The worst part? I didn’t just lose a company. I lost a part of myself.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 2 -->
    <div class="reveal">
      <h3 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: Was It a Trap All Along?</h3>
      <p>
        Electronics. The course I had chosen. The one that was supposed to define my future.
        <br><br>
        It didn’t take long for the realization to sink in: I hated it.
        <br><br>
        Every class felt like a trap. Every lecture, a slow death. This wasn’t me. I wasn’t built for circuit diagrams and transistor theories. I was built for something else. Something bigger. But what?
        <br><br>
        I didn’t have the answer. So I did the hardest thing I had ever done.
        <br><br>
        I quit.
        <br><br>
        Not physically—I was still in college—but mentally, I checked out.
        <br><br>
        For the next four months, I was caught in an endless loop of self-doubt, frustration, and regret.
        <br><br>
        I tried to escape by doing the one thing that had failed me before: JEE.
        <br><br>
        One more attempt. One more desperate shot at changing my fate.
        <br><br>
        And guess what?
        <br><br>
        I ended up almost exactly where I started. Again.
        <br><br>
        Was this a sign? A cruel joke from the universe? Or was I just running in circles, refusing to accept something I wasn’t ready to face?
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 3 -->
    <div class="reveal">
      <h3 id="chapter3">Chapter 3: The Place I Never Chose</h3>
      <p>
        I landed at JIIT. Not by choice. But by fate. The branch was my choice. The college wasn’t.
        <br><br>
        And yet… for the first time in a long time, I felt at peace.
        <br><br>
        Why? Because sometimes, the best thing isn’t the perfect thing. It’s the thing that stops the cycle of regret.
        <br><br>
        The first day felt different. A fresh slate. A new beginning. No baggage. No expectations.
        <br><br>
        I made friends. I found laughter. I settled in. But deep down, I knew this wasn’t the climax of my story.
        <br><br>
        Because something far darker was waiting for me.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 4 -->
    <div class="reveal">
      <h3 id="chapter4">Chapter 4: The Question That Broke Me</h3>
      <p>
        It started with a thought. A simple, innocent question.
        <br><br>
        “What is reality?”
        <br><br>
        Most people ask and forget. I asked and fell into a rabbit hole.
        <br><br>
        Philosophy. Psychology. Existentialism.
        <br><br>
        It was intoxicating. It was terrifying. It was life-changing.
        <br><br>
        The more I read, the more I questioned. The more I questioned, the more I unraveled myself.
        <br><br>
        One night, in a moment of absolute clarity—or madness—I wrote something.
        <br><br>
        "I stood tall, and they praised me. I spoke with certainty, and they listened. Strength drew them near, admiration was abundant—but was it real?"
        <br><br>
        "So I unraveled it. I dimmed my light, softened my voice, became the lowest among them. And as I fell, I watched."
        <br><br>
        "Some turned away, their loyalty tied only to what I was, not who I am. Others revealed scorn, where once there was praise."
        <br><br>
        "What I lost was an illusion. What remained was the truth. And in that truth, I found power."
        <br><br>
        That night, something inside me snapped.
        <br><br>
        I stopped being me.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 5 -->
    <div class="reveal">
      <h3 id="chapter5">Chapter 5: The Biggest Gamble of My Life</h3>
      <p>
        I ruined myself.
        <br><br>
        Not by accident.
        <br><br>
        On purpose.
        <br><br>
        I dismantled everything that made me… me.
        <br><br>
        My charm. My intellect. My confidence.
        <br><br>
        I wanted to see what would happen. I wanted to see who stayed and who left.
        <br><br>
        The result?
        <br><br>
        I became a joke.
        <br><br>
        People laughed at me. Mocked me. Dissected every action, every word, every movement.
        <br><br>
        And I let them.
        <br><br>
        Did it hurt? Yes.
        <br><br>
        Did I regret it? No.
        <br><br>
        Because through the pain, I saw the truth.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 6 -->
    <div class="reveal">
      <h3 id="chapter6">Chapter 6: The Price of the Experiment</h3>
      <p>
        But here’s the thing about experiments.
        <br><br>
        Once you become something else, you don’t always find your way back.
        <br><br>
        I lost myself.
        <br><br>
        I had played a role for so long that I forgot who I actually was.
        <br><br>
        I had become a character in my own story.
        <br><br>
        And the scariest part?
        <br><br>
        I didn’t know if I could ever return.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 7 -->
    <div class="reveal">
      <h3 id="chapter7">Chapter 7: The Final Roll of the Dice</h3>
      <p>
        Looking back, I realized something.
        <br><br>
        What I destroyed, I could rebuild.
        <br><br>
        If I had the power to erase myself, I had the power to create myself again.
        <br><br>
        So I made a decision.
        <br><br>
        Let’s roll the dice again.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Epilogue -->
    <div class="reveal">
      <h3>Epilogue: Who Were F1 and F2?</h3>
      <p>
        (You didn’t think I’d forget, did you?)
        <br><br>
        Their names?
        <br><br>
        That’s not the point.
        <br><br>
        The real question is—does it matter?
        <br><br>
        Because in the end, this story was never about them.
        <br><br>
        It was about me.
        <br><br>
        The Gamble of Becoming.
        <br><br>
        And the realization that, in life—we are all rolling the dice.
